# Flower Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)

## Repository Contents

- `inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for running inference with the trained DDPM model.
- `ddpm-training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the DDPM model on the Flowers-102 dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project.

To set up your environment and replicate the results, follow the instructions below:


### Instructions for Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Python Packages**: 
   - Run the following command to install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
     ```

2. **Install Git LFS**:
   - **Unix-based Systems**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get -qq update
     sudo apt-get -qq install git-lfs
     ```
   - **Windows Systems**:
     Visit the [Git LFS installation page](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and follow the instructions for installing Git LFS on Windows.

3. **Configure Git Credentials**:
   - Run the following command to configure Git to store your credentials:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper store
     ```

### Key Additions

1. **Using the Trained Model**: Download the trained model from releases section. Extract it into a folder.
2. **Updating the Path in Notebooks**: Update the `model_path` variable in the notebooks to point to the directory where the model is placed.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks to train the model and run inference.

### Training the Model

1. Open `ddpm-training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to train the DDPM model using the Flowers-102 dataset.

### Running Inference

1. Open `inference.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions to generate flower images using the trained DDPM model.

## Example Prediction

Here is an example of a flower image generated by the trained DDPM model:
